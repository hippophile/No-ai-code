# Project 00 - Project Picker

## Description
A simple web application that randomly selects a project idea from a predefined list.  
The goal was to build a lightweight tool to practise basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation while exploring how to structure small, self-contained projects.

## Technologies / Tools
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Features
- Presents a predefined list of project ideas.
- Randomly selects and displays one project when a button is clicked.
- Minimal, clean UI for quick interaction.
- Easy to extend by editing the projects list.

## My Experience
This was the first project in my no-AI coding challenge, so I focused on warming up and getting comfortable writing code without external help.  
I struggled initially with using `Math.random()` to select a random idea and mapping that to an array index, and I overcomplicated the logic. After a few iterations and lots of `console.log` debugging, I realised the solution was straightforward. Styling was another hurdle — I wanted the UI clean and readable without investing too much time in CSS. Overall, seeing the final app work after a few hours of trial and error was very satisfying.

## Skills Gained
- Basic DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Effective use of `Math.random()` in a practical context.
- Structuring a small project from scratch.
- Clean separation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Next Steps / Possible Improvements
- Allow users to add their own project ideas.
- Persist custom lists using local storage.
- Add categories or tags for filtering.
- Polish the UI with responsive design.

## AI Usage
Yes — I used AI for CSS styling suggestions and clarification of some JavaScript concepts, but I wrote all the final code myself.
