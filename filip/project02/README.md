# Project 02 - Moodling Experiment

## Description
A small web experiment inspired by the game Slime Rancher.  
I wanted to practise building a no‑AI front‑end from scratch and get comfortable with basic DOM manipulation, event handling and asynchronous JavaScript.

## Technologies / Tools
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Features
- Generates a playful interface based on Slime Rancher aesthetics.
- Fetches quotes from a JSON file and displays them dynamically.
- Uses buttons to hide/show elements and return to previous states.
- Designed to be simple and soothing, without a backend.

## My Experience
I started this purely out of love for Slime Rancher, with no grand goals. My biggest hurdle was understanding how event listeners work; I had almost no JavaScript background, so `addEventListener` and concepts like bubbling and delegation were confusing at first.  
The breakthrough moment was when I successfully fetched JSON data and saw quotes appear on the screen — it felt like magic to move from static HTML/CSS to a data-driven page. Debugging taught me to search targeted questions (“what does e.target mean?”), read MDN documentation and sprinkle `console.log` statements to understand the flow. That process taught me more about reading docs and tracing code than anything else.

## Skills Gained
- DOM selection, creation and updating.
- Event handling, including click listeners and delegation.
- Fetch API with promises and error handling.
- CSS transitions, gradients and positioning.

## Next Steps / Possible Improvements
- Build an interactive to-do app with drag-and-drop functionality to extend these skills.
- Add persistence (e.g. local storage) to maintain state across sessions.
- Refactor into modular functions for better reuse.

## AI Usage
No — I relied on documentation and web searches for explanations, and all code was written manually.
