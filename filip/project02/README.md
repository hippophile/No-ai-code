## My Journey

I started this little **Moodling** experiment purely out of love for **Slime Rancher**—that cute, carefree game that always helps me unwind. I didn’t set out to solve any grand problem; I simply wanted to dip my toes into **no-AI web development**, to build something by hand from the ground up.

### Early Challenges  
My biggest hurdle was JavaScript itself—**event listeners** in particular. Coming in with almost zero JS background, I had no clue what `addEventListener` really did or how bubbling and delegation worked. I spent many evenings puzzling over why my clicks weren’t registering, and why sometimes everything else disappeared.

### Breakthrough & Pride  
The moment I finally **fetched my JSON** data and saw those quotes light up on the screen was pure magic. Suddenly the page felt alive, and I knew I’d crossed a threshold—from static HTML/CSS to a truly data-driven UI.

### How I Debugged  
Whenever something broke, I:  
1. **Googled** targeted questions (e.g. “what does e.target mean?”)  
2. Dug into MDN docs to understand each function’s role  
3. Sprinkled plenty of `console.log` statements until the flow made sense  

That process taught me more about reading docs and tracing code than anything else.

### Skills Gained  
- **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting, creating, and updating elements by hand  
- **Event Handling**: Grasping click listeners and delegation  
- **Fetch API**: Pulling in JSON, chaining `.then()`/`.catch()`  
- **CSS Play**: Transitions, gradients, and positioning tricks  

Now I feel confident wiring up data, user interactions, and styles from scratch—no templates, no shortcuts.

### How It Felt  
Each time something worked—whether hiding the other slimes, displaying a quote, or showing the “Return” button—I felt a rush of satisfaction. Seeing my idea take shape exactly as I pictured it was incredibly rewarding.

### What’s Next  
I’m excited to level up this hands-on learning with an **interactive to-do app**—complete with **drag & drop**, sleek styling, and persistent storage.
