# Project Planning

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

- **Add Todo**: User can create new tasks.  
- **Delete Todo**: User can remove tasks.  
- **Toggle Completion**: Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.  
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Rearrange tasks via drag and drop.  
- **Persistence**: Save tasks so they persist across sessions.  
- **Filters**: View All, Active, or Completed tasks.  
- **Additional Features**: e.g., due dates, priority levels, categories.

## Phase 2: Logic Design (Plain English)

. **Initialization**  
   When the page loads, retrieve any stored tasks and display them in the list.

2. **Adding a Todo**  
   When the user submits a new task, create a task object, add it to the list, save the updated list, and refresh the display.

3. **Deleting or Toggling Completion**  
   When the user deletes a task or toggles its completion status, identify the task, update the list accordingly, save the changes, and refresh the display.

4. **Drag & Drop Reordering**  
   When a task is dragged and dropped to a new position, determine the original and new positions, reorder the tasks in memory, save the updated order, and refresh the display.

5. **Rendering Tasks**  
   Clear the current list display and rebuild it by iterating over the task list, adding each task to the interface with the relevant controls and event handlers.
