# Project 03 - Customizable Todo App

## Description
A web-based todo list with drag-and-drop reordering and customizable tasks.  
The project was created to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, especially DOM manipulation and user interaction, while exploring design and customization.

## Technologies / Tools
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Features
- Initialization: Load stored tasks on page load and render them.
- Adding a Todo: Create a new task object, add it to the list, save and render.
- Deleting or Toggling Completion: Update tasks when users delete or mark them complete, save and re-render.
- Drag & Drop Reordering: Enable users to reorder tasks by dragging items.
- Rendering: Clear the current display and rebuild the list with appropriate controls and event handlers.

## My Experience
This project wasn’t spontaneous; todo apps are typical starter projects. I wanted to include everything from my planning — initialization, adding, deleting, drag-and-drop and rendering.  
Creating new DOM elements in JavaScript was the toughest part; understanding how to create, insert and update elements dynamically took time. The drag-and-drop functionality, on the other hand, came surprisingly easily.  
I enjoyed the design process, both on paper and in CSS, because it forced me to think about user experience and aesthetic details. I found that adding components gradually and debugging methodically (instead of building everything at once) led to fewer issues and a quicker path to a working app. Seeing the draggable tasks move around was the most satisfying moment of the project.

## Skills Gained
- Dynamic creation and manipulation of DOM elements.
- Implementing drag-and-drop interactions.
- Structuring data and synchronizing it with the UI.
- Incremental development and methodical debugging.

## Next Steps / Possible Improvements
- Add task history or an undo feature.
- Implement persistent storage (e.g. local storage) to save tasks across sessions.
- Add categories or labels for filtering tasks.
- Improve accessibility (e.g. keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes).

## AI Usage
No — all logic and debugging were done manually, and AI was only used for clarification of concepts when necessary.
