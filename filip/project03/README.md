# Project Reflection – Customizable Todo App

## Motivation
I started this project to deepen my knowledge mainly in JavaScript and to experiment with other "small things" like draggable objects and customization.  
It wasn’t a spontaneous idea, since creating a todo app is a very basic project when starting in programming.

I wanted it to include everything I mentioned in my planning:
1. **Initialization**  
   When the page loads, retrieve any stored tasks and display them in the list.

2. **Adding a Todo**  
   When the user submits a new task, create a task object, add it to the list, save the updated list, and refresh the display.

3. **Deleting or Toggling Completion**  
   When the user deletes a task or toggles its completion status, identify the task, update the list accordingly, save the changes, and refresh the display.

4. **Drag & Drop Reordering**  
   When a task is dragged and dropped to a new position, determine the original and new positions, reorder the tasks in memory, save the updated order, and refresh the display.

5. **Rendering Tasks**  
   Clear the current list display and rebuild it by iterating over the task list, adding each task to the interface with the relevant controls and event handlers.

The only thing left to implement is the task history, which I already know how to do since I’ve done it in older projects.

## Challenges
I got stuck for quite a while with creating new DOM elements in JavaScript — it took me some time to fully understand it.  
On the other hand, the draggable object functionality was quite easy to grasp.

## Design
I enjoyed the design process — both on paper and in CSS — because my skills gave me full creative freedom.  
This pushed me to improve in order to achieve a result that would truly satisfy me.

## Debugging and Strategy
Debugging was straightforward.  
I didn’t face any serious issues because I added each component gradually, with methodical and strategic thinking.  
I didn’t do everything at once — by following a subtractive thinking approach, everything worked relatively quickly.

## Most Satisfying Moment
The most satisfying part was:
- Getting the draggable feature to work.
- Creating a new task without breaking the rest of the functionality.

## Next Steps
I will soon add task history.  
In the end, this was a simple but very educational todo list.
