# 🚧 Not Going So Well (Yet...)

I’ll be honest — this isn’t going as smoothly as I’d hoped.

I’m still relying on AI-generated code more than I should.  
It’s just too easy, too tempting.  
Sometimes I ask AI for a concept, and it gives me exactly the code I need — even when I explicitly ask it *not* to.

That said, I **have** made progress.  
I've limited my use of AI code. I focus more on debugging, using web searches, and thinking things through myself.  
But I know I can do better.

## 💡 The Plan

I created a project here in ChatGPT under a clear framework — one that helps me **truly** learn programming without falling into the shortcut trap.

Here’s the core idea:

---

# 🧠 AI-Free Programming Learning Framework

## 🎯 Objective

To help me **truly learn programming** (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and beyond) **without copying code from AI**.  
I want to build real foundations, learn to debug, and create from scratch using my own reasoning.

## 🔧 Learning Strategy

Each mini-project follows this 7-phase system:

1. **🔍 Requirements Analysis**  
   - What should the app do?  
   - Define components, actions, and responsibilities.

2. **🧠 Logic Design**  
   - Write pseudocode first.  
   - Break down the logic step by step.

3. **✍️ Code Without AI**  
   - I write all the code myself.  
   - AI doesn’t provide code — only explanations or debugging help.

4. **🐞 Debugging**  
   - I debug my code first.  
   - Then I ask AI what might be wrong (but not how to fix it directly).

5. **🧪 Edge Case Testing**  
   - I test weird inputs and unexpected cases.  
   - I learn how to write resilient code that anticipates errors.

6. **📖 Self-Explanation**  
   - I explain the logic in plain language (or comments).  
   - If needed, I should be able to rebuild the project from scratch.

7. **📈 Reflection**  
   - At the end of each project, I reflect:  
     - What did I learn?  
     - What was confusing?  
     - What do I still need to revisit?  
     - Can I explain this to someone else?

## ✅ Core Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ❌ No copy-paste from AI | AI does not write code for me. |
| ✅ Ask “Why?” or “How?” only | I only ask AI to explain concepts. |
| 🧠 Manual rewriting | If AI *shows* code, I rewrite it my own way. |
| 🗺️ Pseudocode first | No jumping straight into JS — plan first. |
| 📓 Daily Summary | I write what I learned and struggled with each day. |

## 🔄 My Goal

To become a **real developer** who:
- Can design and build software from scratch  
- Understands every line of code  
- Can debug without relying on magic  
- Uses AI as a **mentor**, not as a **crutch**

## 🛫 “Airplane Mode” Coding

From now on, I’m switching to what I call `airplane` coding —  
Just me, my thoughts, my editor.  
No autopilot. No shortcuts.  
Just real learning, one step at a time.
