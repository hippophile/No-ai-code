# No-AI-Projects

> **Yes, AI can help you write code faster, but do you really understand it?**

---

## 🔍 Motivation

I recently built, just for fun, a live website where you can create an account and post anything you want anonymously.  
It worked great—but I **didn’t understand a thing** about all the code I copy-pasted and ran.

So what happens if I want to add a new feature and the AI **can’t** handle my spaghetti code… or new errors pop up?

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

With this repo, I aim to gain **deep understanding** across multiple domains:
- Web design
- Algorithms
- Deep learning

…by **eliminating** any dependency on AI for implementation and debugging.

## 📜 Rules

1. **No AI-generated code**  
   - I must write all code myself; no AI code snippets allowed.  
2. **No AI debugging**  
   - I’ll troubleshoot errors manually: testing, reading docs, StackOverflow, forums.  
3. **AI only for explanations**  
   - If I can’t find an explanation online, I may ask AI to clarify concepts.  
4. **AI only for documentation**  
   - GitHub Copilot may assist **only** with writing documentation.  
5. **AI code is illegal in code blocks**  
   - Every code example in this repo must be entirely hand-written.
