# Project Picker

A simple web app that helps you pick a coding project based on difficulty.


## 🚀 Features

- **Difficulty Filter**  
  Choose between Easy / Medium / Hard to narrow down your next challenge.
- **Random Project**  
  Click "Generate" to get a random suggestion within the selected difficulty.
- **Fully Configurable**  
  Edit or extend the `projects.json` file to add your own ideas.

## 🗂️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – markup  
- **CSS3** – styling (see `styles.css`)  
- **JavaScript (vanilla)** – app logic (`logic.js`)  
- Zero build tools—just a static site.
